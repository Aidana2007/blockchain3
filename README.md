Overview

This repository contains a complete Web3 development environment built with Hardhat for writing, testing, and deploying Ethereum smart contracts using Solidity and Ethers.js. The project includes a custom ERC-20–style token (STeamToken), professional unit tests, and a structured workflow for local and testnet development.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate real-world smart contract engineering practices: clean contract design, automated testing, gas analysis, and secure deployment configuration.
